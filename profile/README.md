Researchers studying sign languages and communication technologies with sign language experience an immense resource gap. Resources for studying visual prosody in sign languages, and its functions, are scarce. This project contributes towards closing this gap and promotes data-driven sign language research. The project aims to create a large sign language corpus with annotation and release this resource for linguistic and sign language technology research, in addition to providing open access teaching modules and assignments with instructor guides for use with the corpus.
